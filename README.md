# README

A relative small setup which lets me create web applications in a modern way
but with out most of the fuss.

This project is a mix of code taken from dependencies I like to create
something that's fun to use and small enough to understand.

The core of the structure is taken from https://github.com/choojs/choo,
creation and rendering of HTML from
https://github.com/WebReflection/lighterhtml and stateful component structure
from https://github.com/bcomnes/lighterhui

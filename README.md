# README

A relative small setup which lets me create web applications in a modern way
but with out most of the fuss.

Everything comes with pros and cons. Browserify and npm made using npm
packages on the web a breeze. This ease of use can also cause you to add more
and more dependencies without actually knowing how they work. A lot of the
authors also want their dependencies to be used by as many people as possible
resulting in them adding extra features (increasing complexity and size).

This project is a mix of code taken from many of my favorite dependencies to
create something that's fun to use and small enough to understand.

The core of the structure is taken from https://github.com/choojs/choo and the
creation and rendering of HTML from
https://github.com/WebReflection/lighterhtml
